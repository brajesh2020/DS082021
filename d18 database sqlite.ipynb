    "Here, we are going to connect SQLite with Python. Python has a native library for SQLite. Let us explain how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use SQLite, we must import sqlite3.\n",
    "Then create a connection using connect() method and pass the name of the database you want to access if there is a file with that name, it will open that file. Otherwise, Python will create a file with the given name.\n",
    "After this, a cursor object is called to be capable to send commands to the SQL. Cursor is a control structure used to traverse and fetch the records of the database. Cursor has a major role in working with Python. All the commands will be executed using cursor object only.\n",
    "To create a table in the database, create an object and write the SQL command in it with being commented. Example:- sql_comm = ”SQL statement”\n",
    "And executing the command is very easy. Call the cursor method execute and pass the name of the sql command as a parameter in it. Save a number of commands as the sql_comm and execute them. After you perform all your activities, save the changes in the file by committing those changes and then lose the connection."
